# Equilibria Ambassador Dashboard plugin code sample
Equilibria needed a better way to share real-time sales analytics data with their brand ambassadors, a large part of their business development unit. As a software engineer at Equilibria, an early-stage cannabis and women’s health startup, I was the lead programmer on this MVP analytics dashboard for brand ambassadors.

I built both the front end and backend of the custom plugin, which stored the functions that incorporated SQL queries that pulled sales data for each brand ambassador on a year-to-date, month-to-date, week-to-date, and today’s date schedule and broke it down by product ID. Brand ambassadors could log into their account and see this data in their dashboard.

Also included in this code sample is the custom page template and styling files needed to render the My Account page.
